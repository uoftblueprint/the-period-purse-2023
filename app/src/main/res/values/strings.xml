        \n\nWith the help of UofT Blueprint from the University of Toronto, we have developed this app to enable you to keep track of your periods and provide you with useful information.
        \n\nWe understand that recording intimate information about your body in an app can be scary. Who can access this information? How will it be used? Is it well protected?
        \n\nThis is why we build this app with your privacy first in mind. Contrary to other period tracking apps, with your Period Purse app, no one but you can access any of the information you provide. This document provides you with more information about how this works and answers some commonly asked questions.
        \n\nYou can also always reach out at hello@periodpurse.com if you cannot find what you are looking for.</string>

    <string name="no_personal_info_access">Nothing! Nor the Period Purse, nor any other organization, can access your personal information.</string>
    <string name="did_you_get_my_consent">Did you get my consent?</string>
    <string name="consent_response">We did not ask for your consent, because we do not want your data. Your data is yours and yours only.</string>
    <string name="did_you_collect_my_data">Did you collect my data?</string>
    <string name="data_collection_response">
        We do not collect your data in any way. Your data is either stored locally on-device or backed up to Google Drive.
        \n\nIn the case of on-device storage, the data is only processed locally and not transmitted off-device.
        \n\nIn the case of storing in Google Drive, we will use Google Drive API and OAuth to achieve end-to-end encryption, and store your data in a hidden, application-specific folder such that no parties, including you or any other application, can access it. The only way you can access this data is when you sign into Menstruation Nation with your Google Account. At any time, you can uninstall Menstruation Nation to delete the backed-up data in Google Drive.

    <string name="do_you_share_my_information_with_anyone">Do you share my information with anyone?</string>
    <string name="information_sharing_response">
        We do not disclose your data to any third party. We could not if we wanted to since we do not have it! All the data that you add to the app to keep track of your periods and your health is stored locally, on your phone, with one exception.
        We wanted you to be able to transfer your data from one device to another in case you change phones, so that you do not lose your history. To make sure this would not jeopardize your privacy, we created an optional feature that enables you to connect your Google account to your app and download all your data to your Google Drive. Upon request, data goes straight from the app to your Google account. You can then access it by logging into Menstruation Nation on your new device.
        Once your data is in your Google Drive, the Google privacy policy applies. We invite you to read it if you have any questions on how Google protects your information. The app also includes some links to social media pages. If you click those links, these pages\' privacy policy applies.

    <string name="information_protected_response">We built this app so that you would feel comfortable tracking your periods on your phone. Not accessing it is the best way for us to protect it.</string>
    <string name="i_am_underage_can_i_use_this_app">I am underage. Can I use this app?</string>
    <string name="under_age_response">From a privacy standpoint, you can use this app whichever your age is, because your data stays with you.</string>
