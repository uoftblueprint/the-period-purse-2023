## About

The Period Purse strives to achieve menstrual equity by providing people who menstruate with access to free menstrual products, and to reduce the stigma surrounding periods through public education and advocacy. This is their [website](https://www.theperiodpurse.com/).

Following the [release of Menstruation Nation on the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1621201647), UofT Blueprint has partnered with The Period Purse for a second project. This time making the Menstruation Nation more accessible by bringing it to the Google Play Store.

**Menstruation Nation is scheduled to launch on Google Play Store in late March 2023**
